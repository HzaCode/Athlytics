# Summary

**Athlytics** is an R package that delivers a **complete, API-free workflow for the reproducible analysis of endurance-training data**. Working entirely from **local Strava archives** (ZIP files or CSVs), it provides an integrated pipeline from import and quality control to key physiological metrics, including **acute-to-chronic workload ratios (ACWR)** [@gabbett2016], aerobic efficiency, and cardiac decoupling. Unlike API-dependent approaches, Athlytics is **offline and cohort-first**, integrating quality control, physiological guardrails, and uncertainty reporting into a single, auditable workflow.

# Statement of Need

Analyzing endurance training data in R often requires stitching together API clients, file parsers, and custom scripts. This creates workflows that are fragile and difficult to reproduce, especially for **cohort-scale** research. **Athlytics** addresses this gap by providing a **single, research-oriented pipeline** that works offline with local archives, offers an integrated suite of physiological models, and is built from the ground up for multi-athlete analysis. This design **reduces "glue code"** and makes cohort-scale analyses auditable and easy to reproduce.

Athlytics is unique in providing an API-free, end-to-end workflow that integrates a full suite of physiological models, uncertainty quantification, and built-in cohort benchmarking features essential for reproducible research.

# Software Description

-   **Inputs & Data Model:** Reads Strava ZIP archives or `activities.csv`. Activity streams (FIT/TCX/GPX) are loaded **on demand** from the archive, optionally using `FITfileR` for FIT files [@FITfileR]. The core function `load_local_activities()` produces a standardized tibble.
-   **Core Metrics:** `calculate_acwr()`, `calculate_ef()`, and `calculate_decoupling()` compute key summaries with sensible, research-oriented defaults. The implementation of ACWR acknowledges its conceptual issues and is presented as a monitoring tool [@impellizzeri2020acwr].
-   **Uncertainty Quantification:** Provides confidence intervals for EWMA-based ACWR using a moving-block bootstrap [@kunsch1989; @politis1994], a key feature for research applications.
-   **Cohort Benchmarking:** `cohort_reference()` computes percentile bands, which can be layered onto individual plots using `plot_with_reference()`.
-   **Plotting & Diagnostics:** Visualization functions follow a **data-first API**. Functions return **diagnostic fields** (e.g., `status`, `reason`) when inputs are insufficient, making the workflow transparent.

# Example

The following example demonstrates a common cohort analysis workflow: loading data from multiple athletes, calculating ACWR for each, and plotting an individual against cohort-wide reference bands.

```r
library(Athlytics)
library(dplyr)

# 1. Load and combine data for a cohort of athletes, adding identifiers
athlete1 <- load_local_activities("athlete1_export.zip") %>% mutate(athlete_id = "A1")
athlete2 <- load_local_activities("athlete2_export.zip") %>% mutate(athlete_id = "A2")
cohort_data <- bind_rows(athlete1, athlete2)

# 2. Calculate ACWR across the entire cohort using a modern dplyr workflow
cohort_acwr <- cohort_data %>%
  group_by(athlete_id) %>%
  group_modify(~ calculate_acwr(.x, load_metric = "duration_mins")) %>%
  ungroup()

# 3. Generate cohort-wide percentile reference bands
reference_bands <- cohort_reference(cohort_acwr, metric = "acwr_smooth")

# 4. Plot an individual's data against the cohort reference
individual_acwr <- cohort_acwr %>% filter(athlete_id == "A1")
plot_with_reference(individual = individual_acwr, reference = reference_bands)
```
