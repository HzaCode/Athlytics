# Prerequisites

## Installation

For installation instructions, see the [README](https://github.com/HzaCode/Athlytics#installation). The quick version:

```{r eval=FALSE}
# CRAN (stable)
install.packages("Athlytics")

# GitHub (latest features)
remotes::install_github('HzaCode/Athlytics')
```

## Your Strava Data Export

You'll need a Strava data export ZIP file. If you haven't exported your data yet, see the [Strava Export Guide](https://support.strava.com/hc/en-us/articles/216918437-Exporting-your-Data-and-Bulk-Export) or follow the steps in the [README Quick Start](https://github.com/HzaCode/Athlytics#quick-start).

**Quick Summary:**
1. Go to Strava Settings → My Account → Download or Delete Your Account
2. Request "Download" (NOT delete!)
3. Wait for email with download link
4. Download the ZIP file (e.g., `export_12345678.zip`)
5. **Don't unzip it** — Athlytics reads ZIP files directly

---

# Loading Your Data

## Basic Loading

```{r eval=FALSE}
library(Athlytics)
library(dplyr)  # For data manipulation

# Load your activities
activities <- load_local_activities("path/to/export_12345678.zip")

# View the first few rows
head(activities)
```

## Understanding the Data Structure

Let's explore what we just loaded:

```{r eval=FALSE}
# How many activities do you have?
nrow(activities)
# Example output: [1] 847

# What sports are in your data?
table(activities$sport)
# Example output:
#   Ride  Run  Swim
#    312  498    37

# Date range
range(activities$date, na.rm = TRUE)
# Example output: [1] "2018-01-05" "2024-12-20"

# Key columns in the dataset
names(activities)
```

**Important Columns:**

- `activity_id` — Unique identifier
- `date` — Activity date
- `sport` — Activity type (Run, Ride, Swim, etc.)
- `distance_km` — Distance in kilometers
- `duration_mins` — Duration in minutes
- `avg_hr` — Average heart rate (if recorded)
- `max_hr` — Maximum heart rate
- `avg_pace_min_km` — Average pace for running
- `avg_speed_kmh` — Average speed
- `avg_power` — Average power for cycling (if available)
- `elevation_gain` — Total elevation gain (meters)
- `best_efforts` — Personal best times at various distances

## Data Quality Checks

Before analysis, it's good practice to check your data:

```{r eval=FALSE}
# Summary statistics
summary(activities %>% select(distance_km, duration_mins, avg_hr))

# Check for missing heart rate data
sum(!is.na(activities$avg_hr)) / nrow(activities) * 100
# Shows % of activities with HR data

# Activities without HR data
activities %>% 
  filter(is.na(avg_hr)) %>%
  count(sport)
```

**Pro Tip:** Many Athlytics functions require heart rate data. Filter for `!is.na(avg_hr)` when calculating EF or decoupling.

## Filtering Your Data

For focused analysis, you'll often want to filter by sport or date:

```{r eval=FALSE}
# Only running activities
runs <- activities %>% 
  filter(sport == "Run")

# Recent activities (last 6 months)
recent <- activities %>% 
  filter(date >= Sys.Date() - 180)

# Runs with heart rate data from 2024
runs_2024_hr <- activities %>% 
  filter(sport == "Run",
         !is.na(avg_hr),
         lubridate::year(date) == 2024)

# Long runs only (> 15 km)
long_runs <- activities %>% 
  filter(sport == "Run", distance_km > 15)
```

# Core Analyses

Now let's dive into the main analytical features. Each metric provides different insights into your training and physiology.

---

## 1. Training Load (ACWR)

**What is ACWR?**

The Acute:Chronic Workload Ratio (ACWR) compares your recent training (acute load, typically 7 days) to your long-term baseline (chronic load, typically 28 days). It's used to identify injury risk periods.

**Risk Zones:**

- **< 0.8** — Undertraining (fitness may decline)
- **0.8-1.3** — "Sweet spot" (optimal adaptation zone)
- **1.3-1.5** — Moderate risk (load increasing rapidly)
- **> 1.5** — High risk (excessive load spike, injury risk)

### Basic ACWR Calculation

```{r eval=FALSE}
# Calculate ACWR for all running activities
acwr_data <- calculate_acwr(
  activities_data = runs,
  activity_type = "Run",        # Filter by sport
  load_metric = "duration_mins", # Can also be "distance_km" or "hrss"
  acute_period = 7,              # 7-day rolling average
  chronic_period = 28            # 28-day rolling average
)

# View results
head(acwr_data)
```

**Output Columns:**

- `date` — Date
- `daily_load` — Training load for that day (sum of duration/distance)
- `atl` — Acute Training Load (7-day rolling average)
- `ctl` — Chronic Training Load (28-day rolling average)
- `acwr_smooth` — The ACWR ratio (ATL / CTL)

### Visualizing ACWR

```{r eval=FALSE}
# Basic plot
plot_acwr(acwr_data)

# With risk zones highlighted (recommended)
plot_acwr(acwr_data, highlight_zones = TRUE)
```

### Interpreting Your ACWR

**What to look for:**

1. **Gradual increases** = Good progressive overload
2. **Sharp spikes above 1.5** = Warning signs, consider recovery
3. **Extended periods < 0.8** = May need to increase training volume
4. **Stable values in 0.8-1.3** = Optimal training stimulus

**Practical Example:**

```{r eval=FALSE}
# Identify high-risk periods
high_risk <- acwr_data %>%
  filter(acwr_smooth > 1.5) %>%
  select(date, daily_load, acwr_smooth)

print(high_risk)

# Check recent trend
recent_acwr <- acwr_data %>%
  filter(date >= Sys.Date() - 60) %>%
  arrange(desc(date))

head(recent_acwr, 10)
```

### Choosing Load Metrics

Different load metrics for different goals:

- **`duration_mins`** — Simple, works for all sports, good for general monitoring
- **`distance_km`** — Better for distance-focused training (marathon prep)
- **`hrss`** — Most accurate for physiological load (requires HR data)

```{r eval=FALSE}
# Calculate using HRSS (heart rate stress score)
acwr_hrss <- calculate_acwr(
  activities_data = runs,
  load_metric = "hrss"  # Automatically calculated if avg_hr available
)
```

---

## 2. Efficiency Factor (EF)

**What is EF?**

Efficiency Factor measures how much output (speed/power) you generate per unit of input (heart rate). It's a key indicator of aerobic fitness improvements.

**Metrics:**

- **Pace/HR** (running) — Speed per heartbeat: Higher = better aerobic fitness
- **Power/HR** (cycling) — Watts per heartbeat: Higher = better aerobic fitness

**What Changes Mean:**

- **Increasing EF** = Aerobic fitness improving (doing more work at same HR)
- **Stable EF** = Maintaining current fitness
- **Decreasing EF** = Fatigue, overtraining, or fitness loss

### Calculate EF

```{r eval=FALSE}
# For running (Pace/HR)
ef_runs <- calculate_ef(
  activities_data = runs,
  activity_type = "Run",
  ef_metric = "pace_hr"  # Pace divided by HR
)

# For cycling (Power/HR)
rides <- activities %>% filter(sport == "Ride")
ef_cycling <- calculate_ef(
  activities_data = rides,
  activity_type = "Ride",
  ef_metric = "power_hr"  # Power divided by HR
)

# View results
head(ef_runs)
```

**Output Columns:**

- `date` — Activity date
- `ef_value` — Efficiency Factor value
- `avg_hr` — Average heart rate
- `avg_pace_min_km` (or `avg_power`) — Output metric

### Visualizing EF Trends

```{r eval=FALSE}
# Basic plot
plot_ef(ef_runs)

# With smoothing line to see trend (recommended)
plot_ef(ef_runs, add_trend_line = TRUE)
```

### Interpreting EF

**Best Practices:**

1. **Track trends over weeks/months**, not day-to-day fluctuations
2. **Use steady-state efforts only** — Interval workouts will skew results
3. **Consider external factors** — Heat, altitude, fatigue affect EF

**Practical Analysis:**

```{r eval=FALSE}
# Calculate monthly average EF
library(lubridate)

ef_monthly <- ef_runs %>%
  mutate(month = floor_date(date, "month")) %>%
  group_by(month) %>%
  summarise(
    mean_ef = mean(ef_value, na.rm = TRUE),
    n_activities = n()
  ) %>%
  arrange(desc(month))

print(ef_monthly)

# Compare first vs last 3 months
recent_ef <- ef_runs %>% filter(date >= Sys.Date() - 90) %>% pull(ef_value)
baseline_ef <- ef_runs %>% filter(date < Sys.Date() - 90, date >= Sys.Date() - 180) %>% pull(ef_value)

cat(sprintf("Recent EF: %.2f\nBaseline EF: %.2f\nChange: %.1f%%\n",
            mean(recent_ef, na.rm = TRUE),
            mean(baseline_ef, na.rm = TRUE),
            (mean(recent_ef, na.rm = TRUE) / mean(baseline_ef, na.rm = TRUE) - 1) * 100))
```

## 3. Cardiovascular Decoupling

**What is Decoupling?**

Decoupling quantifies cardiovascular drift—the phenomenon where heart rate gradually rises during prolonged efforts even if pace/power remains constant. Low decoupling indicates good aerobic endurance.

**How It Works:**

The function compares efficiency (pace/HR or power/HR) between the first half and second half of an activity:

$$
\text{Decoupling \%} = \left(\frac{\text{EF}_{\text{2nd half}}}{\text{EF}_{\text{1st half}}} - 1\right) \times 100
$$

**Interpretation:**

- **< 5%** — Excellent aerobic base, well-adapted
- **5-10%** — Acceptable, some drift but manageable
- **> 10%** — Significant drift (fatigue, heat, insufficient base fitness)

### Calculate Decoupling

```{r eval=FALSE}
# For running
decoupling_runs <- calculate_decoupling(
  activities_data = runs,
  activity_type = "Run",
  decouple_metric = "pace_hr",
  min_duration_mins = 60  # Only analyze runs ≥ 60 minutes
)

# For cycling
decoupling_rides <- calculate_decoupling(
  activities_data = rides,
  activity_type = "Ride",
  decouple_metric = "power_hr",
  min_duration_mins = 90  # Longer threshold for cycling
)

# View results
head(decoupling_runs)
```

**Output Columns:**

- `date` — Activity date
- `first_half_ratio` — EF in first half
- `second_half_ratio` — EF in second half
- `decoupling_pct` — Percentage drift

### Visualizing Decoupling

```{r eval=FALSE}
# Basic plot
plot_decoupling(decoupling_runs)

# With metric specification
plot_decoupling(decoupling_runs, decouple_metric = "pace_hr")
```

### Practical Applications

**1. Assess Aerobic Base:**

```{r eval=FALSE}
# Recent decoupling average
recent_decouple <- decoupling_runs %>%
  filter(date >= Sys.Date() - 60) %>%
  summarise(avg_decouple = mean(decoupling_pct, na.rm = TRUE))

if (recent_decouple$avg_decouple < 5) {
  cat("Excellent aerobic base! Ready for higher intensity.\n")
} else if (recent_decouple$avg_decouple < 10) {
  cat("Good base, continue building aerobic foundation.\n")
} else {
  cat("High decoupling—focus on more easy, long runs.\n")
}
```

**2. Monitor Training Block Progress:**

```{r eval=FALSE}
# Compare decoupling over time
library(ggplot2)

decoupling_runs %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = date, y = decoupling_pct)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.6) +
  geom_smooth(method = "loess", se = TRUE) +
  geom_hline(yintercept = 5, linetype = "dashed", color = "green") +
  geom_hline(yintercept = 10, linetype = "dashed", color = "orange") +
  labs(title = "Decoupling Trend Over Time",
       subtitle = "Lower values = better aerobic endurance",
       x = "Date", y = "Decoupling (%)") +
  theme_minimal()
```

**Important Note:** Decoupling is highly affected by environmental conditions (heat, humidity) and cumulative fatigue. Always interpret in context.

## 4. Personal Bests (PBs)

Track your best performances at standard distances over time.

### Calculate PBs

```{r eval=FALSE}
# Extract personal bests
pbs <- calculate_pbs(
  activities_data = runs,
  activity_type = "Run"
)

# View all PRs
print(pbs)
```

**Supported Distances:**

- 400m, 800m, 1km, 1 mile
- 5km, 10km
- Half marathon, Marathon

### Visualize PB Progression

```{r eval=FALSE}
# Plot PR progression
plot_pbs(pbs)

# Filter to specific distance
pbs_5k <- pbs %>% filter(distance == "5k")
print(pbs_5k)
```

---

## 5. Load Exposure Analysis

Visualize your training state in 2D space: acute load vs chronic load.

### Calculate and Plot Exposure

```{r eval=FALSE}
# Calculate exposure
exposure <- calculate_exposure(
  activities_data = runs,
  activity_type = "Run",
  load_metric = "duration_mins"
)

# Plot with risk zones
plot_exposure(exposure, highlight_zones = TRUE)
```

**Interpretation:**

- **Points above diagonal** = Acute > chronic (ramping up training)
- **Points on diagonal** = Balanced state
- **Points below diagonal** = Tapering or recovery
- **Red zone** = High ACWR, injury risk

---

# Complete Workflow Example

Here's a realistic, end-to-end analysis workflow:

```{r eval=FALSE}
library(Athlytics)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)

# ---- 1. Load and Filter Data ----
activities <- load_local_activities("my_strava_export.zip")

# Focus on running activities with HR data
runs <- activities %>% 
  filter(sport == "Run", !is.na(avg_hr))

cat(sprintf("Loaded %d running activities with HR data\n", nrow(runs)))

# ---- 2. Training Load Monitoring ----
acwr_data <- calculate_acwr(
  activities_data = runs,
  load_metric = "duration_mins"
)

# Check current training status
current_acwr <- acwr_data %>% 
  filter(date >= Sys.Date() - 30) %>%
  tail(1) %>%
  pull(acwr_smooth)

cat(sprintf("Current ACWR: %.2f\n", current_acwr))

# Visualize
p1 <- plot_acwr(acwr_data, highlight_zones = TRUE) +
  labs(title = "6-Month Training Load Progression")
print(p1)

# ---- 3. Aerobic Fitness Tracking ----
ef_data <- calculate_ef(
  activities_data = runs,
  ef_metric = "pace_hr"
)

# Calculate fitness trend
ef_trend <- ef_data %>%
  mutate(month = lubridate::floor_date(date, "month")) %>%
  group_by(month) %>%
  summarise(mean_ef = mean(ef_value, na.rm = TRUE))

p2 <- plot_ef(ef_data, add_trend_line = TRUE) +
  labs(title = "Aerobic Efficiency Trend")
print(p2)

# ---- 4. Endurance Assessment ----
# Only for long runs (> 60 min)
decoupling_data <- calculate_decoupling(
  activities_data = runs,
  min_duration_mins = 60
)

avg_decouple <- mean(decoupling_data$decoupling_pct, na.rm = TRUE)
cat(sprintf("Average decoupling: %.1f%% (%s aerobic base)\n",
            avg_decouple,
            ifelse(avg_decouple < 5, "excellent",
                   ifelse(avg_decouple < 10, "good", "needs work"))))

p3 <- plot_decoupling(decoupling_data) +
  labs(title = "Cardiovascular Drift in Long Runs")
print(p3)

# ---- 5. Export Results ----
# Save plots
ggsave("acwr_analysis.png", plot = p1, width = 10, height = 6, dpi = 300)
ggsave("ef_trend.png", plot = p2, width = 10, height = 6, dpi = 300)
ggsave("decoupling.png", plot = p3, width = 10, height = 6, dpi = 300)

# Export data for further analysis
write.csv(acwr_data, "acwr_results.csv", row.names = FALSE)
write.csv(ef_data, "ef_results.csv", row.names = FALSE)
write.csv(decoupling_data, "decoupling_results.csv", row.names = FALSE)

cat("\nAnalysis complete! Results saved.\n")
```

# Troubleshooting

## Common Issues

### "No data returned" or empty results

**Causes:**
- Activity type filter doesn't match your data
- Required metrics (e.g., HR) are missing
- Date range has no activities

**Solutions:**

```{r eval=FALSE}
# Check activity types in your data
table(activities$sport)

# Check for HR data availability
sum(!is.na(activities$avg_hr))

# Verify date range
range(activities$date, na.rm = TRUE)

# Try without filtering first
test <- calculate_acwr(activities_data = activities, activity_type = NULL)
```

### "Not enough data for chronic period"

ACWR requires at least 28 days of data. Check your date range:

```{r eval=FALSE}
# How much data do you have?
date_span <- as.numeric(max(activities$date) - min(activities$date))
cat(sprintf("Your data spans %d days\n", date_span))

# If < 28 days, you need more data or use shorter periods
```

### "NA values in output"

Some activities may lack required metrics (HR, power, etc.):

```{r eval=FALSE}
# Filter before calculating
runs_with_hr <- runs %>% filter(!is.na(avg_hr))
ef_data <- calculate_ef(runs_with_hr, ef_metric = "pace_hr")
```

### Plots look strange or empty

```{r eval=FALSE}
# Check if data exists
nrow(acwr_data)
summary(acwr_data$acwr_smooth)

# Try basic R plot first
plot(acwr_data$date, acwr_data$acwr_smooth, type = "l")
```
