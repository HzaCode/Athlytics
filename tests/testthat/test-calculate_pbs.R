# --- Test API Interaction and Core Logic with Mocking ---

# Helper to create a mock rStrava::get_efforts_list return value
# This function will simulate finding best efforts for given distances within a single activity's efforts list
# It's a simplified mock focusing on returning plausible data for calculate_pbs

# The actual get_efforts_list returns a list of data frames, one for each segment effort in an activity.
# Each data frame has columns like: id, resource_state, name, activity, athlete, elapsed_time, moving_time, start_date, start_date_local, distance, start_index, end_index, pr_rank, segment.id, segment.name, etc.
# For calculate_pbs, we are interested in finding the best `elapsed_time` for a `distance` that is close to the target distances.
# The function internally seems to look for `segment.distance` matching `distance_meters`.
  # Mock returns list of efforts for one activity
# To test calculate_pbs properly, we need to simulate get_efforts_list being called for *each* activity from get_activity_list

# Mock for get_efforts_list: needs to be adaptable or we mock its caller if calculate_pbs has an internal helper.
# calculate_pbs directly calls get_efforts_list(act_data = activity_list, stoken = stoken, id = current_activity_id)
# So, the mock needs to handle different `id` arguments if we want to simulate different efforts for different activities.
# For simplicity, let's make it return the *same* set of efforts for any activity ID, but this means PBs will always come from the same mocked efforts.
