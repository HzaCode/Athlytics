Description: An open-source computational framework for longitudinal analysis of 
    exercise physiology metrics using local 'Strava' data exports. Designed 
    for personal analysis and sports science applications, this package provides 
    standardized functions to calculate and visualize key physiological indicators 
    including Acute:Chronic Workload Ratio (ACWR), Efficiency Factor (EF), and 
    training load metrics.
