Few examples `Athlytics` may have:

### 1. Load Exposure

This analysis provides an intuitive way to assess your current training load status and potential injury risk level. You can clearly see where your load combination (e.g., high acute load on high chronic load vs. high acute load on low chronic load) falls within defined risk zones (like the sweet spot, caution zone, or danger zone).

### 2. ACWR Trend

With this analysis, you can monitor the rate of change in your training load over time, helping to identify periods of rapid increases that might lead to overtraining or heightened injury risk. It's a valuable tool for periodized training monitoring and risk management.

### 3. Efficiency Factor Trend

The Efficiency Factor (EF) is a common metric for assessing aerobic fitness adaptations. Ideally, EF should trend upwards as fitness improves, indicating higher output for the same physiological cost. This analysis helps track long-term aerobic efficiency progress and may signal accumulating fatigue or fluctuations in form.
